# ⚠️ Important Update Notice

## Mandatory Full Re-download for Versions **below v5.69**

If you are currently running **any version lower than v5.69**, **incremental or delta updates are not supported**.

### What this means
- Your existing installation **cannot be updated safely**
- Continuing to use the built-in updater **will fail or cause issues**
- A **full re-download and reinstall is required**

### Required action
1. **Uninstall** the current application
2. **Download the latest release** from the official source
3. **Install fresh**

### Why this is necessary
Versions prior to **v5.69** use an outdated packaging and update layout that is **incompatible with the current update system**. This is a hard technical limitation.

**There is no workaround.**

## Features

### Session Tracker
Monitor your practice sessions in real-time. Companella automatically detects completed plays and records accuracy, difficulty ratings, and more. Review your session history to see how your performance evolves throughout each practice session.

### Smart Map Recommendations
Get personalized beatmap recommendations based on your current skill level. Choose from different focus modes:
- **Push** - Maps slightly above your comfort zone to help you improve
- **Consistency** - Maps at your level to build reliable accuracy
- **Deficit Fixing** - Maps targeting your weaker skillsets
- **Skillset Focus** - Practice specific patterns or techniques

### Session Planner
Plan your practice sessions effectively. Set goals and let Companella help you structure your practice time for maximum improvement.

### Overlay Mode
Companella automatically attaches to your osu! window as a companion overlay. It stays visible while you play and hides when you switch to other applications. Toggle visibility with a (not yet but soon) customizable hotkey (ALT+Q for now).

### Beatmap Detection
Automatically detects the beatmap you're viewing or playing in osu!. No need to manually drag and drop files - just open a map in osu! and Companella picks it up.

### Mapping Tools
Tools for beatmap creators:
- **BPM Analysis** - Automatically analyze and generate timing points from audio
- **SV Normalization** - Normalize scroll velocity across BPM changes
- **Offset Adjustment** - Quickly apply timing offsets to all timing points

### Auto-Updates
Companella checks for updates automatically and notifies you when a new version is available.
