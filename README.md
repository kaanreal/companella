# Important Update Notice

## Mandatory Full Re-download for Versions **below v5.69**

If you are currently running **any version lower than v5.69**, **incremental or delta updates are not supported**.

### What this means
- Your existing installation **cannot be updated safely**
- Continuing to use the built-in updater **will fail or cause issues**
- A **full re-download and reinstall is required**

### Required action
1. **Uninstall** the current application
2. **Download the latest release** from the official source
3. **Install fresh**

### Why this is necessary
Versions prior to **v5.69** use an outdated packaging and update layout that is **incompatible with the current update system**. This is a hard technical limitation.

**There is no workaround.**
